# cf-gsoc-2018-ideas
List of Cloud Foundry project ideas for Google Summer of Code

1. AutoBroker: Convert any Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes application into an Open Service Broker that can instantiate app into any platform supporting OSBI (Open Service Broker Interface)

2. BOSH release linter, migrator, or verifier. Check BOSH releases for issues and migrate releases to latest techniques and features, e.g., links

3. CLI chat bot: A bot that can be used to issue CF CLI commands and get simplified results. This would require thinking for each command how to make input/output into a conversation.

Online debug of CF Apps	Have a means to automatically expose a debugging endpoint to each (enabled) CF apps to allow devs to see code, change, save and force restart of app w/o having to leave browser.

BOSH Lite on Kubernetes	Improve / redo BOSH lite by running it on Kubernetes. This could be done via CPIs or combination of CPIs and tunning runtime or both.
